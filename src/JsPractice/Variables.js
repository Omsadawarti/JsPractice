// There are three types of variables in JS.
// let(local scope) , var(global scope) and const(defines a variable as constant in js)
// let and const are introduced after ES6
// we can re-declare var but not let
// for eg:
// var a = 20;
// var a = 30 // valid

// let a = 30;
// let a = 90; //invalid and throw and error

console.log(
  "This program will introduce you with differnt types of variables in JS"
);
